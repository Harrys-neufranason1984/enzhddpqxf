Oh my god, just got out of You're Cordially Invited and it's like my head's been stuffed with flowers, but not in a pleasant way. It’s like being in a garden where all the plants are screaming. I sat down—my back is still aching from those theater seats, they’re like medieval torture devices—and I can’t even find a working quiet spot; the car noise is just all-consuming, like I'm buried in a beehive.

There’s this part where the bride is running through the rain and it’s all in slow-motion, she’s a drenched, crumpled ball of white lace and regret. It made me think of that one time I tried to skateboard during a thunderstorm in flip-flops. Don't ask why, just you had to be there, damn.

> Popcorn crumbs are everywhere—I thought they were hail in the scene where the reception tent just collapses in on itself. Crunch, crunch, and all over my lap. I'm surprised they didn't just all start eating the popcorn from their dresses—caught in there like some weird novelty, you know, like those rainy paper flowers you see expanding in water at grandma's house.

I bet someone’s gonna say “download the movie” later, but honestly, it's… like trying to smell a rose in a snowstorm. You get glimpses, but mostly you’re just slapped in the face with snowflakes. Maybe I'm just tired? I swear I'm not drunk, or I would probably be understanding the metaphorical goats better. There was a random goat, did I mention that? Chewing on the bride’s bouquet like it was happening in a parallel universe styled after a Dali painting.

Really, watch the movie, if only for that one maid-of-honor speech that’s delivered like she's reading an instruction manual for assembling IKEA furniture while on a rollercoaster. It’s mesmerizing and completely befuddling all at once.

Anyway, need to grab a coffee and maybe a back massage after this ordeal. Too many sensory explosions in there, my brain feels like a bouquet of wilting daisies. Ugh, sorry if I’m rambling—it’s all tangled up like last year’s holiday lights in my head right now.
